Starting on July 23, 2020 we are launching a space for unstructured, free-wheeling conversations with the MAIEI Staff and AI Ethics community at large to talk about whatever is on your mind in terms of building responsible AI systems. We will be talking about research, news, academia, industry, policy, and anything else that you have on your mind. This is a place for human connection in distanced times - we look forward to having you join us!

This will be a *30 minutes session* from 12:15 pm ET to 12:45 pm ET so bring your lunch (or tea/coffee)!
